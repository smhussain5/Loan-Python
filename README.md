# LOAN REPAYMENT PYTHON

![Loan Repayment Python GIF Demonstration](https://github.com/smhussain5/Loan-Python/blob/main/LOAN_PYTHON.gif?raw=true)

## Problem 🤔

Fundamentals in Python are extremely important and require practice; however, practice should not be boring. The best way is to develop your own projects regardless of how "simple" it may seem.

## Solution 💡

This terminal application utilizes user input to create an interactive experience. The Locale module allows for formatting of user input to USD currency. Variables stored are used to calculate payments. The application logic is wrapped within a while loop that allows for users to calculate again if they would like.

## Technologies Used ⚙

- PyCharm 
- Python
  - Input
  - "Locale" module
  - While loop

## Challenges 💢

This was a straightforward application, but required proper organization for clean code. Fortunately, PEP8 guidelines built into PyCharm allows developers to follow best practices easily!

## Insights 💭

This project was great practice for conditionals like while loops and if/else statements. It was also great to follow PEP8 guidelines for better code readibility.
